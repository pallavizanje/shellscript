# Stage 1: Build the React TypeScript app using Node.js 18
FROM node:18 as build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies first, so they can be cached
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application (assuming you have a "build" script in package.json)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the build with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove the default Nginx static assets
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy the build output from the first stage to Nginx's html directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to be accessible from outside the container
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
